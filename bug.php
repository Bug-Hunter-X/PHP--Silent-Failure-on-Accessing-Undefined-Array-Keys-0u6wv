In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["a"] = 1;
$myArray["b"] = 2;
echo $myArray["c"]; //Notice the key "c" is not set
?>
```

Accessing a non-existent array key doesn't throw an error; instead, it silently returns `null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues, especially in larger applications.  The issue is exacerbated when the code expects an integer value and performs calculations based on the result, leading to unexpected `0` results or even worse, if the null is used in a calculation that can produce a fatal error.
